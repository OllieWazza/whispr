## 🚀 How to Use

### First-Time Setup

1. **Copy environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Run the database setup:**
   - Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ptrpavczxoutgxxyqcew)
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy contents from `src/supabase.sql`
   - Run the script

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **(Optional) Set up OAuth:**
   - Follow instructions in `SETUP_OAUTH.md`
   - Configure Google OAuth
   - Configure Apple OAuth

### Testing the Integration

1. **Test Buyer Sign-up:**
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5173/signup/buyer
   - Create account
   - Should redirect to /buyer-dashboard
   ```

2. **Test Creator Sign-up:**
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5173/signup/creator
   - Create account
   - Should redirect to /creator/dashboard
   ```

3. **Test Sign-in:**
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5173/signin
   - Sign in with test account
   - Should redirect based on user_type
   ```

4. **Test Protected Routes:**
   ```
   - Try accessing /buyer-dashboard without auth → redirects to /signin
   - Sign in as buyer → access granted
   - Try accessing /creator/dashboard → redirects to /buyer-dashboard
   ```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Sign Up Flow
```
1. User visits /signup/buyer or /signup/creator
2. Fills out form (name, email, password)
3. Clicks "Continue"
4. AuthContext.signUp() is called
5. Supabase creates auth user
6. Profile created in users table with user_type
7. User signed in automatically
8. Redirected to appropriate dashboard
```

### Sign In Flow
```
1. User visits /signin
2. Enters email and password
3. Clicks "Sign in"
4. AuthContext.signIn() is called
5. Supabase authenticates user
6. Profile fetched from users table
7. Redirected based on user_type:
   - buyer → /buyer-dashboard
   - creator → /creator/dashboard
```

### OAuth Flow
```
1. User clicks "Continue with Google/Apple"
2. Redirected to OAuth provider
3. User authenticates with provider
4. Redirected back to app
5. Supabase creates/signs in user
6. Profile checked for user_type
7. Redirected to appropriate dashboard
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ Users can only update their own profile
- ✅ Buyers can only view their own orders
- ✅ Creators can only manage their own listings
- ✅ Private storage buckets for sensitive content
- ✅ Protected routes enforce user type
- ✅ Session management with auto-refresh

## 📊 Database Structure

### Key Tables

**users**
- Stores both buyers and creators
- `user_type` field determines access
- Auto-updating rating and stats

**listings**
- Created by creators only
- Linked to user via `user_id`
- Supports tiers (standard, premium, exclusive)

**orders**
- Links buyers to creators
- Tracks order status and delivery
- Auto-updates creator stats

**reviews**
- One review per order
- Auto-updates listing and user ratings

---

## 🎯 Current State

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- Email/password authentication
- User type separation (buyer/creator)
- Protected routes by user type
- Real data fetching from Supabase
- Profile management
- OAuth support (requires configuration)
- Database schema with RLS
- Storage buckets defined

### 🔄 Ready for Implementation
- Listing creation for creators
- Order creation for buyers
- File uploads to storage
- Review submission
- Payment integration (Stripe)
- Real-time notifications
- Search and filters

---

## 📝 Important Notes

### User Types
- Users are EITHER buyer OR creator (not both)
- User type is set during signup
- Cannot be changed after creation (requires manual DB update)

### Data Fallbacks
- Marketplace and home pages show mock data if database is empty
- This allows development without test data
- Real data automatically appears when creators join

### OAuth Users
- First-time OAuth users need to select user type
- Currently redirects immediately after OAuth
- Consider adding a profile setup page for better UX

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER commit `.env.local` to git**
- Use `.env.example` as template
- Production needs different URLs

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing Supabase environment variables"**
→ Create `.env.local` from `.env.example`

**Auth not working**
→ Run the SQL script in Supabase Dashboard

**No creators showing**
→ Expected if database is empty, mock data will show

**OAuth not working**
→ Follow `SETUP_OAUTH.md` setup guide

**Wrong dashboard after signin**
→ Check user_type in Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → users

2. Create `.env.local` file
3. Test buyer and creator sign-ups
4. (Optional) Configure OAuth providers
5. Start building listing creation for creators
6. Implement order flow for buyers
7. Add Stripe payment integration

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**

All authentication and database integration is complete. You can now:
- Sign up as buyer or creator
- Sign in and access appropriate dashboards
- View real creators from database (or mock data as fallback)
- Use protected routes based on user type

**Happy coding!** 🚀
