# Authentication & Categories Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ RLS Policy Error for Creators
**Problem:** `new row violates row-level security policy for table "creators"`

**Root Cause:** The RLS policy was too restrictive. It only allowed inserts where `auth.uid() = id` but didn't specify it should be for `authenticated` users.

**Solution:** Updated policies to explicitly target `authenticated` role:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create creator profile"
  ON public.creators FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

### 2. ✅ Categories Replaced with Tone Tags
**Old Categories:** Personal, Voiceover, Product, etc.

**New Tone Tags:** 20 voice tone descriptors for creators to tag their listings:

**Row 1 (Primary):**
- Flirty 😘
- Playful 😄
- Soothing 😌
- Sultry 🔥
- Soft-spoken 🤫
- Energetic ⚡
- Seductive 💋
- Innocent 😇
- Dominant 👑
- Submissive 🙇
- Sweet 🍬
- Naughty 😈

**Row 2 (Secondary):**
- Teasing 😏
- Confident 💪
- Shy 🙈
- Professional 💼
- Casual 👕
- Intimate 💕
- Passionate ❤️‍🔥
- Mysterious 🎭

### 3. ✅ Creator Access Control
**Protected Routes:**
- `/creator/dashboard` - Only creators can access
- `/creator/upload` - Only creators can post/upload

**How it works:**
1. `ProtectedRoute` component checks `profile.user_type`
2. If user is not a creator, redirects to appropriate dashboard
3. If not authenticated, redirects to `/signin`

**Code:**
```typescript
<Route path="/creator/dashboard" element={
  <ProtectedRoute requiredUserType="creator">
    <CreatorDashboardPage />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Quick Fix (If you already ran fresh install)
Run the fix script in Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor** → **New Query**
2. Copy and paste `fix-creators-rls-and-categories.sql`
3. Click **Run**

This will:
- ✅ Fix the creators RLS policy
- ✅ Replace categories with tone tags
- ✅ Fix buyers RLS policy (for consistency)

### Option 2: Fresh Start (Recommended if starting over)
Run the updated fresh install script:

3. Click **Run**

This includes all fixes from the start.

## What's Already Protected

### Frontend Protection ✅
- **AuthContext:** Checks both `buyers` and `creators` tables
- **ProtectedRoute:** Enforces `requiredUserType` on routes
- **Sign Up:** Creates profile in correct table (`buyers` or `creators`)

### Backend Protection ✅
- **RLS Policies:** Only authenticated users can create profiles
- **Listings:** Only creators can create/edit/delete listings
- **Orders:** Buyers can create, creators can fulfill
- **Reviews:** Only buyers who completed orders can review

## Testing

1. **Sign up as Creator:**
   - Go to `/signup/creator`
   - Fill in details and submit
   - Should successfully create account in `creators` table
   - Redirects to `/creator/dashboard`

2. **Sign up as Buyer:**
   - Go to `/signup/buyer`
   - Fill in details and submit
   - Should successfully create account in `buyers` table
   - Redirects to `/buyer-dashboard`

3. **Access Control:**
   - Try accessing `/creator/upload` as a buyer → Redirects to `/buyer-dashboard`
   - Try accessing `/buyer-dashboard` as creator → Redirects to `/creator/dashboard`
   - Try accessing protected routes while logged out → Redirects to `/signin`

## Next Steps

After running the fix:
1. ✅ Test creator signup
2. ✅ Test buyer signup
3. ✅ Verify tone tags appear in the categories table
4. ✅ Test that only creators can access creator pages
5. ✅ Test that listings can use the new tone tags

All done! 🎉
